Fibropapillomatosis incidence in Florida and Bahimian green turtles

This undergraduate research project is supported by Florida State University's Marine Turtle Research, Ecology, and Conservation Group.
Supervised by Joshua Cullen, PhD; and Mariana M.P.B. Fuentes, PhD

The goal of this project is to investigate the rates, counts, sources, and progression of Fibropapillomatosis incidence in green turtles spatiotemporally 
around Florida and the Bahamas, primarily in the Crystal River and Bimini areas specifcally.

Scripts present were created in RStudio, an open source and enterprise-ready professional software for data science.
Various packages were used, all of which included in the the header for each script. A script titled "packages.R" details the arguments to install each 
package used.
